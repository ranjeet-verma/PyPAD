# Overview

PyPAD is a lightweight python file and GUI application.
It lets you execute code written in languages such as C, C++, Java and Python with specified input and output fields.
Note that PyPad is an interface and does not contain any libraries or files for any language. Hence it is important to install gcc/g++ compiler #for C, C++ and JDK for java 
and python libraries for python codes on user's machine.
The modules used to develop the application are Tkinter, Subprocess and OS module.

# How to run the application

Download the PyPad.py file and double click on it to run. 
We can also open the application by excuting pypad.py file through command prmpt.
Make sure the icon file is in the same folder as the PyPad.py. If the icon file does not exist.
The app will run just fine displaying the tkinter default icon.

# Functionalities

The application has many features. Some are as follows:
The application mainly consists of three text fields - for input, output and the code.
There are menu options for file operation such as open, save, edit. 
We can use open file option to open any coding file and then execute it by choosing the appropriate language option from run options.
We can also write any code in the code field and then execute it.
We can provide custom input for our programs in the input field.
The output will be shown in the output field.
If the program results in error/exception the same will be shown in the output field.
There are other options to explore as well.
