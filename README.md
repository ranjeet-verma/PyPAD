# PyPAD
#PyPAD is a lightweight python file and GUI application that lets you execute code written in languages such as C, C++, Java and Python with specified input and output fields.
#Note that PyPad is an interface and does not contain any libraries or file for any language. Hence it is important to install gcc/g++ compiler for C, C++ and JDK for java and python libraries for python codes on user's machine.
